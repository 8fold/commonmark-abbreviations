<h1>8fold Abbreviations for Commonmark</h1>
<p>This library is an extension of the <a href="https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark">Commonmark parser</a> from the PHP League that adds abbreviation syntax and rendering to Markdown.</p>
<p>This text is written using the syntax to be used to test the validity of the extension; therefore, it will most likely not render as intended.</p>
<h2>The syntax</h2>
<p>Similar to the link format: [](). Only preceded by a tilde and one empty space: ~[]()</p>
<p>The syntax is inspired by a <a href="https://talk.commonmark.org/t/abbreviations-and-acronyms/890">conversation on the Commonmark site</a> and other implementations.</p>
<p>When it came to deciding between find-and-replace (or replace all) versus inline - inline was selected.</p>
<p>Inline gives the author more fine-grain control over what becomes an <abbr title="abbreviation">abbr</abbr> and what doesn't. This also reduces complexity for the implementation and solves the concern of only defining first use as recommended by <a href="https://plainlanguage.gov/resources/articles/keep-it-jargon-free/">the <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> Plain Language Guidelines</a> and similar guides.</p>
<p>The consensus in the discussion seemed to fall on using the link syntax: [](). Which is also used with an exclamation mark prefix for images: ![](). It is also similar to the syntax used for footnotes: [^]:. Essentially, in cases where two subparts are to be combined, one subpart is wrapped in square brackets while the second subpart is wrapped in <abbr title="parentheses">parens</abbr> or otherwise separated from the square brackets.</p>
<p>Given the common usage of the <abbr title="abbreviation">abbr</abbr> <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> element, the link syntax makes sense. With that said, there didn't seem to be a consensus around the starting glyph. Common implementations seem to use the asterisk; however, this doesn't seem like the best choice, for reasons also brought up in the discussion thread. Beyond those, I will only add that the asterisk, used in this context, doesn't seem to be natural or communicative device - more one of convenience - consider the caret used for the footnote.</p>
<p>As such, I decided to go with the tilde - because math and what abbreviations and acronyms represent - namely, a symbol that needs to be unpacked to gain full understanding.</p>
<p>In algebra, the tilde signifies approximation. In <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheets">CSS</abbr> the &quot;~=&quot; selector signifies the hope that the string on the left will be a part of the string on the right, which is what abbreviations and acronyms tend to represent. So, it's &quot;kind of&quot; this thing - I can almost picture someone putting their hand out palm down rotating back-and-forth to say, &quot;maybe&quot; while kind of drawing a tilde in the air.</p>
<p>I don't believe abbreviations are in any of the popular Markdown specifications and implemented only in Markdown parsers; therefore, this is my humble nod and submission to the problem.</p>
